The goal of anki-extractoR is to easily extract anki flash cards from different 
file types (LaTex mostly) by adding comments with anki to the source file.

## Installation

probably won't be on cran, so either download the .R script or 
install via devtools

``` r
devtools::
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(anki-extractoR)
## basic example code
```

## Roadmap/TODOs

- [ ] Add these todos as issues instead.
- [ ] Add support for different number of fields in a document.
- [ ] Settle on a format style for the inline arguments (f=1, f:1, -f 1?).
- [ ] Command line interface.
- [ ] Add support for cloze. 
- [ ] Maybe make a Docker?
